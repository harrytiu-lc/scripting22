			<p>Felonius Gru popularly known as "Gru" is the lead character in the computer-animated media franchise "Despicable Me". A reformed super-villain who once concocted a plan to steal the Earth's moon with his assistant Doctor Nefario and his army of Minions. Because the plan is expensive, Gru decided to apply for a bank loan from the Bank of Evil. The director of the Bank of Evil will approve his loan application only if Gru can steal a dreaded Shrink Ray. In his quest to steal the Shrink Ray, Gru met three orphan girls - Margo, Edith and Agnes in which he somehow used them to steal the Shrink Ray and eventually adopted them. Gru met his wife Lucy Wilde Gru from the AVL Anti-Villain League when she decided to recruit Gru to investigate the theft of a mutagen called PX-41 serum, stolen from the arctic circle.</p>
